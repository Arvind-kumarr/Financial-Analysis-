# Financial-Analysis-of-bank-account-holders
Objective: understanding the characteristics and behaviors of bank account holders based on this Bank given data.

Data Source: I have imported this dataset from kaggle which an ocean of all datasets and cleaned it with help of python.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary Statistics: Key summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for relevant variables.
Data Visualization: The visualizations used to explore the data, such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.
Distribution of Variables: The distribution of variables including age, income, account balances, etc.
Correlation Analysis: Highlightend any significant correlations between variables, if applicable.
Outlier Detection: Discussed about the outliers detected in the data and how they were handled.
Missing Data: Addressed the missing data was handled during the analysis, whether through imputation, removal, or other methods.
Insights:The key insights obtained from the analysis, such as:

Demographic Profiles: The typical demographic characteristics of bank account holders.
Financial Behavior: Checked the common trends or patterns in financial behavior, such as saving habits, investment preferences, etc.
Account Balances: Highlighted the trends or patterns in account balances and their distribution across different groups.
Limitations: Limitations of the analysis are as data quality issues, sample bias, or constraints imposed by the dataset.

Future Work:  predictive modeling can be done on my EDA , segmentation analysis, or further exploration of specific variables can be done.

Dependencies: Using Machine learninng anyone can predict the modelling.
